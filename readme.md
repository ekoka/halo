# HALO (Hypertext Application Language Output)

A Python tool to create documents following the [HAL specification](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html). HAL is useful to organize and standardize the format of hypertext resources (e.g. REST).

A corresponding tool is available to read formatted HAL documents called HALI (HAL Input) written in ES6 JavaScript. It can be helpful when consuming resources from an API. It wraps the document into an object for easier data access and manipulation.
