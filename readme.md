# HALO (Hypertext Application Language Output)

HAL is useful to organize and standardize the format of hypertext resources.

HALO is a Python tool that helps you organize your resources by abiding to the [HAL specification](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html).

It currently only returns resources in the JSON media type (application/hal+json).

A corresponding tool is available to read formatted HAL documents called HALI (HAL Input) written in ES6 JavaScript. It can be helpful when consuming HAL formatted resources (e.g. from an API).
